# Recommendation-System---Transformer-Approach

Recommendation systems are a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "preference" a user would give to an item.They are primarily used in commercial applications.In this paper,we approach the recommendation systems using the Transformers - firstly, we implement a Behaviour Sequential Transformer model which translates the user behavior into sequences and predicts a rating for each target item. For our second approach we leveraged the Matrix Factorization and enhanced it using BERT embeddings from the items, to create a hybrid approach by combining Content-based filtering with Collaborative filtering approach. Further, we built a K-Nearest Neighbor model to capture the change in item embeddings and used the newly generated embed
